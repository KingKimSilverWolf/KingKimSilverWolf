  <b>About me </b>🧔🏾‍♂️

  🚀 Software Engineer 🌟

My name is Kim Magidhi, a software engineer passionate about building scalable, user-centered solutions that bridge technology and everyday life. 🚀

💻 I’ve developed full-stack applications, real-time analytics platforms, and mobile experiences — from React dashboards powered by FastAPI and PostgreSQL to NFC-enabled loyalty apps and interactive kiosks.

🔧 My toolbox spans modern languages and frameworks: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift/SwiftUI, React, React Native, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Redis, AWS, Docker, and more. I thrive on tackling challenging problems across the stack — whether optimizing backend pipelines for thousands of data points per minute or crafting engaging frontends with D3.js and Three.js.

🌍 I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and create impact. My projects reflect that vision: helping businesses harness data, enabling seamless customer engagement, and delivering beautiful, performant user experiences.

📚 Always learning, I’m currently deepening my expertise in system design, cloud infrastructure, and data-intensive applications as I pursue my long-term goal of building world-class products that scale globally.
